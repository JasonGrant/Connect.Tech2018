Patterns that Demystify Great UX/UI

There is no magic black box for User Experience (UX), User Interface (UI) and Interaction Design (IxD). While you typically see numerous topics on the research, process and tools, a majority of it boils down to common sense patterns that are easy to follow.
 
If you believe that one needs to be an artist to envision a great interface or that it takes too much effort, then this session will help you debunk this myth. 
 
Whether or not you have UX staff, the common patterns behind great experiences and interfaces are easy to follow. These patterns are global and can be applied to any framework or UI library. I will provide you with actionable information, checklists to reference during a project and ways to test what has been created.
